if you're gonna make your own shell pay heed:
shell generating shit is in etc.dic if you need it. TEST YOUR SHELL!!! block builder 2000 looks for all DEFINED surfaces which for reasons i can't discern did not work until i added dressups in the second shell. (onshellchanged is supposed to update the info, that's in boot.dic if you want to take a look)

godspeed aspiring shell soldier. i hope you have better luck than i do

also if you want some fun palettes you can look in the palettes_rejectedColors.zip. i put the ones i'm not using in there
